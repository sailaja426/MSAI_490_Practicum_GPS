# Ghana Panel Survey Analysis

## Project Overview
This repository contains the data analysis and model development for studying mental health status changes in individuals over a series of three surveys conducted every five years in Ghana. The primary objective is to identify key variables that affect mental health status, as indicated by the variables `kessler_dummy2`, `kessler_dummy3`, and `kessler_dummy4`.

## Data
The data for this project is sourced from the Ghana Panel Survey. Due to confidentiality and data privacy, the raw data is not available in this repository. 

## Models
The analysis includes several machine learning models:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Decision Trees
- XGBoost

Each model is used to predict mental health status and identify the most influential predictors.

## Setup
To set up the project environment to run the notebooks and scripts, follow these steps:
1. Install Python 3.8 or above.
2. Install the required packages:
3. Ensure data files are placed in the `data/` directory.
